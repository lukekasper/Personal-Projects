## Common Linux Cmds:
- `man <command>`: prints out cmd manual
  - `tldr <command>`: abbreviated overview of command
  - use the `q` key to escape the man page
- `ls -al <pathway>`: returns additional info about files in a directory
  - from left to right: file permissions, number of links to the file, owner, group, file size (bytes), last modification time, name
  - `a` option is what shows hidden files as well (prefaced by a `.`)
- `cd`: use `.` to indicate current folder and `/` to start a path from the root folder
- `pwd`: prints current folder path
- `mkdir -p fruits/apples`: use `-p` to make nested folders
- `rmdir fruits cars`: to remove multiple directories; folder you delete must be empty
- `rm -rf fruts cars`: to delete folders with files in them
- `mv pear1 pear2 new_pear`: used to move and rename files; if the last parameter is a folder, it will move the specified file(s) into that folder
- `cp -r fruits cars`: to copy files and folders, adding `-r` is necessary when working with folders to copy the entire folder's contents
- `open <filename>` or `open <director name>`: opens a file or directory (on mac OS opens finder)
  - can also use `open <app name>` to run an application
- `touch apple`: creates an empty file; if one already exists, it opens the file in write mode
- `find . -name '*.js'`: prints the relative path for a file with the given extension in the current directory
  - `find . -type d -iname src`: d = directories, f = files, l = symboolic links; iname performs case-insensitive search
  - `find folder1 folder2 -name filename.txt -or -name public`: search under multiple root trees; use `-or` to search for multiple names/types
  - `find . -type d -name '*.md' -not -path 'node_modules/*': use `-not` to exclude a path
  - `find . -type f -size +100c`: files that have more than 100 characters (bytes)
  - `find . -type f -size +100k -size -1M`: search based on file size (in bytes)
  - `find . -type f -mtime +3`: files edited more than 3 days ago
  - `find . -type f -mtime -1 -delete`: delete files matching search (edited in the last 24 hours)
  - `find . -type f -exec cat {} \;`: pipe in commands to run on search results
    - `\;` used to terminate and `{}` is filled with file names at the time of execution
- `ln`: used to create links (or pointers to another file like windows shortcuts)
  - `ln -s <original> <link>`: soft links; when original file is moved, link is broken
- `gzep -k1 filename`: compresses file; `-k` specifies keep the original file; `-1` means level of compression from 1=least to 9=most
  - use `-r` to compress all files in a directory
  - use `-d` to decompress a file
  - `gunzip` is like `gzip` but by default has the `-d` flag enabled
- `tar -czf archive.tar.gz file1 file2`: write files to a zipped archive
  - `tar -xf archive.tar -C directory`: extract files from an archive to a specific directory
  - `-tf`: lists files in an archive 
- `alias ll='ls -al'`: create an alias for a cmd with optional flags
  - calling `alias` with no options shows all defined aliases
  - resets once shell is closed unless defined in shell configuration (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile` or `~/.bash_profile`)
  - single quotes: variable is defined at definition time
  - double quptes: variable is defined at invocation time
- `cat file1 file2 > file3`: concatenate content of files into a new file (overwriting file if it exists)
  - `>>`: appends contents of files to new file
  - `-n`: print line numbers
  - `cat file1 | anothercommand`: feed file's content into another command
- `less <filename>`: to view a file's content in a concise UI
  - `q`: quit
  - `b`: navigate page-by-page
  - `G` jump to end of page and `g` to jump back to start
  - `/ <word>` to search forward in document and `? <word>` to search backwards
  - `v`: open text editor (usually `vim`)
  - can open multiple files and navigate using `:n` (next) and `:p` (prev)
- `tail -f /var/log/system.log`: use to open a file and watch for changes
  - changes are printed in the window; great for monitoring log files
- `ls -al | wc`: use `wc` with `|` to get info about a file or input
  - returns: # of lines, # of words, # of bytes
- `grep`: used to search in a file or the output of another command
  - `less index.md | grep -n document.getElementById`: search file for "document.getElementById"
  - `-n`: prints line numbers
  - `-i`: searches case insensitive
  - `-nC <num>`: prints n number of lines before and after grep result
  - search string can be a regular expression
  - `-v`: invert result
- `sort <filename>` or `ls | sort`: sort a file or output of a command
  - `-r`: reverses order
  - `--ignore-case`: sort case insensitive
  - `-n`: sort numerically
  - `-u`: remove duplicate lines
  - use with `uniq` to further tailor output
    - `sort dogs.txt | uniq`: remove duplicates
    - `-d`: display only duplicates
    - `-u`: display only non-duplicates
    - `-c`: count occurences of each line
    - `sort dogs.txt | uniq -c | sort -nr`: sort lines by most frequent
- `diff file1 file2`: displays difference between two files
  - 2a3 = 2nd file has an extra line at line 3
  - 2d3 = 2nd file is missing a line at line 3
  - `-y`: compares files line-by-line
  - `-u`: display dfferences in Git format
  - `-ur` or `-rq` to display differences between directories (content difference vs which files differ)
- `echo`: print to terminal
  - `echo "hello" >> output.txt`: append output to a file
  - `echo "The path variable is $PATH"`: interpolate environmental variables (escape special chars with `\`)
