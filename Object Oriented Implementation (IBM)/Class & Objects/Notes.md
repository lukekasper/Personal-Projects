- A class is the generalized blueprint for which objects are constructed from
  - describes the state (data or attributes) and behavior that an object of this type supports
  - fundamental building block of C++
- An object is an instance of a class
  - syntax: class_name object_name (ie Employee empObj)
  - when object is created, all data members are assigned default values
- Attributes are instance variables or data memebers or class variables
  - used to declare properties of a class (called data members)
  - can be intrinsic type (int, double, ect), or user defined type
  - syntax of an attribute:
    - <visibility modifier>: <type> <name> [= <initial_value>]
    - ie) private: double salary
- Methods define behavior of an object derived from the class
  - will have a name and return type (void means no return type)
  - <visibility modifier>: <returnType> <methodName> (<arguement>)
    {
       <statement
    }
- Access to attributes and members is done with "."
