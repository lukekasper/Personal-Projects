## Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms
- Abstract data types or strucutres (ADTs): linked list, stack queue, graph tree ...
  - we can use these datatypes and perform operations with them, but do not know how they work internally
- common operations on data structures: insert, modify, delete, search, sort, merge, traverse...
- Non-primitive data structures:
  - linear: stores data sequentially
    - static: array
    - dynamic: linked list, stack, queue
  - non-linear: trees, graphs
    - collection of randomly distributed set of data joined by a reference pointer

## Arrays and Linked Lists
- list: ordered collection of elemeents that may occur more than once
- array: homogeneous data and fixed size
  - can be single or multidimensional
  - pros:
    - index or randomely access elements frequently
    - when low memory is required
  - cons:
    - static: array size must be known beforehand and stays fixed
    - complicated insertion and deletion: requires shifting elements
  - applications: ticketing or booking system, leaderboards for games, image/speech processing (2D)
- linked list: collection of nodes in a linear sequence
  - has memory allocated seperately for each node
  - uses pointers or references to connect nodes together
  - each element contains data and a reference to the next node
    - null reference means it is the last node in the list
  - dynamic structure: can increase or decrease size at runtime
    - no need to shift items during insertions or deletions
  - pros:
    - grows or shrinks dynamically
    - no restrictions on operations: can be done on any part of the list
    - no memory waste
  - cons:
    - more memory due to data + reference address
    - traversal is difficult (must traverse all nodes before n)
      - reverse traversal requires additional memory for pointer to reference in the opposite direction
- linked lists can be: 
  - singly (one-way)
  - doubly: both directions; includes two addresses
  - circularly linked: last node references first node; no null values; can be singly or doubly linked
- applications: not sure about number of elements, browser cache, undo/redo, track info in a circular manner (ie player turns)
