## Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms
- Abstract data types or strucutres (ADTs): linked list, stack queue, graph tree ...
  - we can use these datatypes and perform operations with them, but do not know how they work internally
- common operations on data structures: insert, modify, delete, search, sort, merge, traverse...
- Non-primitive data structures:
  - linear: stores data sequentially
    - static: array
    - dynamic: linked list, stack, queue
  - non-linear: trees, graphs
    - collection of randomly distributed set of data joined by a reference pointer
