## Components
- React functional components are functions that return JSX objects (html-like code)
- Rect component names **must be capitalized** to function properly
  - `quot;` can be used as a quotation mark in html to avoid linter errors
- Rules of JSX:
  - Return a single root element: must return a single top-level element, but can wrap multiple child elements in it
    - Can use a React fragment `<>` if you do not want the child elmements to have a container
  - Close all tags
  - camelCase **most** things:
    - Can't use dashes or reserved words like "class"
- Use curly braces {} to reference a dynamic property inside the markup
  - Can also use this to call functions directly in the markup
  - Use curly braces as text or as attributes only in the markup
  - Double curly braces {{ }} are used to contain JacaScript objects
