## Function vs Method Invocation
- Invocation is the process of evaluating a funciton body by calling it
- A function invocation is defined by a name and arguments passed through parentheses: parseInt(23)
- A method is invoked through a property accessor: obj.myFunc()

## Scoping
- "var" scopes variables within a function
- "let" and "const" block scope variables
  - variables are scoped to the nearest {}, this can be within if statements or for loops
