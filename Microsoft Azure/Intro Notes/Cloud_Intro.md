Intro to Cloud:
- Cloud computing: delivery of computing services over the internet
  - Includes virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking; also includes things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
  - All cloud services provide compute power and storage
    - Compute power: how much processing your computer can do (can add or remove computing power as needed)
    - Storage: amount of data a computer can store
      - Cloud provider ensures backups to data, operating system is up to date, system is running 24/7
- Uses internet to deliver services, eleminating physical constraints for IT expansion like constructing additional datacenters
  - Actual hardware and servers are hosted by providers datacenter, reducing upkeep costs for the user

Shared Responsibility Model:
- Responsibilities for upkeep are shared between cloud provider and consumer
  - Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider
  - Consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud and access security
  - Service model will determine responsibility for things like: Operating systems, Network controls, Applications, Identity and infrastructure
    - Infastructure as a Service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (IaaS)
