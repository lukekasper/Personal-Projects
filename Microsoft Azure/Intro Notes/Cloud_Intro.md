Intro to Cloud
- Cloud computing: delivery of computing services over the internet
  - Includes virtual machines, storage, databases, and networking; also includes things like Internet of Things (IoT), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI)
  - All cloud services provide compute power and storage
    - Compute power: how much processing your computer can do (can add or remove computing power as needed)
    - Storage: amount of data a computer can store
      - Cloud provider ensures backups to data, operating system is up to date, system is running 24/7
- Uses internet to deliver services, eleminating physical constraints for IT expansion like constructing additional datacenters
  - Actual hardware and servers are hosted by providers datacenter, reducing upkeep costs for the user

Shared Responsibility Model
- Responsibilities for upkeep are shared between cloud provider and consumer
  - Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider
  - Consumer is responsible for the data and information stored in the cloud and access security
  - Service model will determine responsibility for things like: Operating systems, Network controls, Applications, Identity and infrastructure
    - Infastructure as a Service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (IaaS)

Cloud Models
- Define the deployment type of cloud resources
- Private cloud:
  - A cloud used by a single entitiy
  - Much greater control for the company
  - Greater cost and fewer benefits compared to public cloud
  - May be hosted at on-site datacenter, or third party
- Public cloud:
  - Built, controlled, and maintained by a third party
  - Anyone can purchase services and access resources
- Hybrid cloud:
  - Uses both public and private clouds
- Multi-cloud:
  - Use multiple public cloud providers, using different features from each
- Azure Arc: set of technologies that help manage cloud environments
  - Azure VMware Solution lets you run your VMware workloads in Azure with seamless integration and scalability

Consumption-Based Model
- Two types of expenses to consider for IT infastructure models: capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx)
  - CapEx: one-time cost for tangible resources
  - OpEx: money spent on products/services over time (cloud computing)
- Consumption model: you only pay for the IT resources you use, not the electrecity, security, ect associated with maintaing a datacenter
  - No upfront costs
  - No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that users might not use to its fullest potential
  - The ability to pay for more resources when they're needed
  - The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
