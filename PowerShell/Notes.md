## Introduction to PowerShell
- Types of commands: native executables, cmdlets, functions, scripts, or aliases
- Cmdlets (compiles commands) follow a verb-noun syntax; helps programmers understand the command intention
- Using Get-Command will return thousands of commands, must filter to make response useful
  - Flags applied to either the noun or verb will accomplish this, using pattern matching for example
    - Flags expect a string value
  - Output of this looks like a table in the shell console, but is actually an object
  

## Discover Commands in PowerShell
- The help cmdlet returns a page with multiple sections:
  - NAME: Provides the name of the command
  - SYNTAX: Shows ways to call the command by using a combination of flags, and sometimes, allowed parameters
  - ALIASES: Lists any aliases for a command. An alias is a different name for a command, and it can be used to invoke the command
  - REMARKS: Provides information about what commands to run to get more help for this command
  - PARAMETERS: Provides details about the parameter. It lists its type, a longer description, and acceptable values, if applicable
- Some flags to reduce the number of pages reutrned from the help cmdlet
  - Full: Returns a detailed help page. It specifies information like parameters, inputs, and outputs that you don't get in the standard response
  - Detailed: Returns a response that looks like the standard response, but it includes a section for parameters
  - Examples: Returns only examples, if any exist
  - Online: Opens a web page for your command
  - Parameter: Requires a parameter name as an argument. It lists a specific parameter's properties
- "help" alias pipes Get-Help into a funtcion which makes response readable line-by-line and page-by-page
  - view results line-by-line with arrow key and page-by-page with space bar
- Get-Member: is piped on top of another command to filter output (know more about what is returned and how you can alter it)
  - when you know the tpye of returned object, you can search for other commands that operate on this
  - response is verbose, meaning it returns many columns
  - use Select-Object to filter on what columns to return
    - use either a comma-seperated list of columns or "*" to display all
  - 

- Cmds:
  - Get-Verb: list of approved PowerShell verbs (with descriptions)
  - Get-Command: lists all available cmdlets in your system
    - Get-Command -Verb Get -Noun a-noun*
      - "-Noun" targets part of command thats a noun
      - "a-noun*" targets all commands whose Noun starts with "a-noun"
      - likewise the first part targets commands whose verb is "Get"
  - Get-Help: invoke built-in help system; can also use alias of "help"
  - Get-Member: response of a command is an object with many properties; use this command to drill down into object and get more details
  - Get-Help -Name Get-Help: invoke "Get-Help" and then specify the name of the cmdlet after "-Name" (in this case the Get-Help cmdlet)
  - Get-Help Get-FileHash -Examples: only return examples of the cmdlet
    - Get-FileHash returns the hashing function output for a file using the specified hashing algorithm
    - Hashing functions produce an output based on the content of the file, they help ensure file contents have not been altered
  - Get-Process -Name 'name-of-process' | Get-Member:
    - Result of Get-Process is passed as an input to Get-Member by using pipe "|"
    - This returns the Name, MemberType, and Definition columns, along with the type of returned object
    - Get-Process returns a list of processes running on your machine
  - Get-Command -ParameterType Process: to search cmdlets that use the type "Process"
    - use if returned object type is "TypeName: System.Diagnostics.Process" for example
  - Get-Process -Name 'name-of-process' | Get-Member | Select-Object Name, MemberType
    - specifies you only want the Name and MemberType columns returned
    - can add -MemberType Method flag to specify you only want to return MemberTypes that are a method
