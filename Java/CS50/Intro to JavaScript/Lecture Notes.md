Notes:
- Javascript will allow us to write client side code
  - as oppose to the server-side code we've been writing in our Django-based web applications
  - code will run inside of user's web browser
  - computations may be faster on client side
  - pages can be much more interactive, as java allows us to manipulate the content of the webpage
- Javascript can be incorporated into a webage through a <script> tag in html structure
- Event-driven programming:
  - ie) user clicks on a button/selects from a dropdown
  - can add event listeners or handlers to run blocks of code when events happen
  - code will allow page to respond to user interactions
