## Common Linux Cmds:
- `man <command>`: prints out cmd manual
  - `tldr <command>`: abbreviated overview of command
- `ls -al <pathway>`: returns additional info about files in a directory
  - from left to right: file permissions, number of links to the file, owner, group, file size (bytes), last modification time, name
  - `a` option is what shows hidden files as well (prefaced by a `.`)
- `cd`: use `.` to indicate current folder and `/` to start a path from the root folder
- `pwd`: prints current folder path
- `mkdir -p fruits/apples`: use `-p` to make nested folders
