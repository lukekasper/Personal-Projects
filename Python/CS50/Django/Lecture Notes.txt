General Notes:
- Django allows for html code to be dynamically updated as user interacts with website
- Django allows developer to code python functions into http responses
- Django best practice is to preface index.html files with the app name (ie hello/index.html) to avoid having conflicting index file names


Django commands:
- pip3 install Django
- HTTP: protocal for how messages are sent back and forth over the internet
    - HttpResponse("some string"): imported django functionality to give an http response
    - from django.http import HttpResponse


Steps to generating django app:
1) django-admin startproject <PROJECT_NAME>: automatically creates starter files to build web application (ex: Lecutre 3)
    - project is where a developer can build multiple apps within (think google)
2) python manage.py 
    - runserver: command to run manage.py
    - startapp <app_name>: command to create an application (think google maps) (ex: hello)
3) settings.py:
    - add new app to list of apps to run (INSTALLED_APPS = ['app_name'])
4) views.py: things a user might want to see
    - add function definition to say what to do when user interacts with url
    - def index(request):
        return HttpResponse("response")
5) urls.py: file to define which urls are available to interact with for that app
    a) create in app directory
    b) add: from django.urls import path
    c) add: from . import views ("." means from current directory)
    d) add urls to list variable
        - paths("", views.index, name="index")
        - "" says when user visits the default route
        - views says run function from views.py
        - index is name of function to call when visiting url from views.py
        - name makes path easy to reference
    e) go to urls.py in overall project directory and add path to new application
        - and include all urls from urls.py in application
        - path('hello/', include("hello.urls")): look at urls.py inside of hello directory to see additional urls user can access
        - make sure to import "path" at top from django.urls


Adding additional functionality:
- add additional funciton to views.py
- add a new path in urls.py so if user adds additional pathway (ie: /hello/Brian/) then it will run new function
- add in additional parameter to function definition to parameterize function
        - use formatted string to use placeholder for output in HttpResponse
        - use <str:name> as first path parameter to pass user input from url into new function
        
        
To create html code more generally:
- return render(request, "hello/index.html") in views.py index function definition
- pass name of html template as arguement
- create new directories for "template" sub-folder "hello" in larger "hello" app directory
