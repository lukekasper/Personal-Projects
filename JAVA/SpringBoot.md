## Getting Started
- Create a new springboot project: https://start.spring.io/ or through IDE
- Get dependencies from maven central repository
  - Typically want to remove versions from spring framework dependencies in pom.xml to let springboot framework manage that
- Spring MVC: Model View Controller
  - Model: Data + Logic
  - View: What user sees on frontend
  - Controller: Mediator (ie API)
- Controllers:
  - Use annotation `@Controller` above Java class
  - `@RequestMapping("/<url pattern>")` above method: creates api endpoint
- Run application:
  - `./mvnw`: maven wrapper to run maven from commandline
  - `./mvnw spring-boot:run`: start springboot application
- Automatic Restart:
  - spring-boot-devtools: add tag `<optional>true<optional/>`
  - compiler settings -> build project automatically
  - advanced settings -> allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running
- Applicaiton properties:
  - Add them to application.properties
  - Use `@Value("${application property key}")` annotation
-  Dependency Injection:
  -  Use an "interface" to loosely couple dependencies
    - Contract that outlines capabilities of a class (no implementation)
  - Pass dependency as argument in constructor
  - Can inject dependencies via setter if the dependency is optional
- "Beans" are JAVA objects managed by the Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) container
  - Spring takes care of creating it, injecting dependencies, and managing its lifecycle
- Annotations:
  - `@Component`: tell spring to manage objects of this type
  - `@Service`: classes that contain business logic (this is also an alias for `Component` annotation)
  - `@Repository`: classes that interact with a databse
  - `@Controller`: for marking classes as controllers for handling web requests
- Common errors:
  - BeanCreationException: Error creating bean for '<classname>'
    - Must use `@Autowired`
  -
