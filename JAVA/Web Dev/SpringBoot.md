## Getting Started
- Create a new springboot project: https://start.spring.io/ or through IDE
- Get dependencies from maven central repository
  - Typically want to remove versions from spring framework dependencies in pom.xml to let springboot framework manage that
- Spring MVC: Model View Controller
  - Model: Data + Logic
  - View: What user sees on frontend
  - Controller: Mediator (ie API)
- Controllers:
  - Use annotation `@Controller` above Java class
  - `@RequestMapping("/<url pattern>")` above method: creates api endpoint
- Run application:
  - `./mvnw`: maven wrapper to run maven from commandline
  - `./mvnw spring-boot:run`: start springboot application
- Automatic Restart:
  - spring-boot-devtools: add tag `<optional>true<optional/>`
  - compiler settings -> build project automatically
  - advanced settings -> allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running
- Applicaiton properties:
  - Add them to application.properties
  - Use `@Value("${application property key}")` annotation
-  Dependency Injection:
  -  Use an "interface" to loosely couple dependencies
    - Contract that outlines capabilities of a class (no implementation)
  - Pass dependency as argument in constructor
  - Can inject dependencies via setter if the dependency is optional
- "Beans" are JAVA objects managed by the Spring IOC (Inversion of Control) container
  - Spring takes care of creating it, injecting dependencies, and managing its lifecycle
  - By default, beans get created once at application start, even if you call `context.getBean(...)` multiple times
    - Spring framework uses "singleton" design pattern
    - Can use`@Scope(value="prototype")` to have it create object instance on demand
  - Use `@Autowired` when creating dependencies
- Annotations:
  - `@Component`: tell spring to manage objects of this type
  - `@Service`: classes that contain business logic (this is also an alias for `Component` annotation)
  - `@Repository`: classes that interact with a databse
  - `@Controller`: for marking classes as controllers for handling web requests
  - `@RestController`: create a REST api endpoint
  - `@RequestMapping`: create api route for method to handle
  - `@Scope(value="prototype")`: will not create a bean instance by default, but on call to "getBean"
  - `@Autowired`: automatically manage dependency injection (must use with multiple constructors in a class)
    - Searches by type by default
  - `@Qualifier("<name>")`: to get object by name
  - `@RequestParam("name")`: get http request parameters
  - `@RequestHeader()`: used to get http request header info
  - `@RequestBody`: used to access info in POST request body
  - `@PathVariable`: binds input parameter to variable in the URI path
  - `@EntityGraph`:use when fetching an object to eagerly load other attributes as well and perform joins
  - `@Query`: write custom SQL queries
- Common errors:
  - BeanCreationException: Error creating bean for '<classname>'
    - Must use `@Autowired`
  - NoSuchBeanDefinitionException: No qualifying bean of type '<classname>'
    - Class did not use `@Component` annotation

## Web Development
- Create .jsp pages in "webapp" folder under main
- Testing APIs: use Postman app:
- Data Transfer Object (DTO): Java object used to transfer data between different layers of an application
  - This limits what data gets exposed to outside clients from the API, making API more stable
  - Any updates to data model just need to get reflected in mapping code, clients do not need to change
- Model libraries (MapStruct) can be used to map these DTOs more efficiently
- To build a API endpoint you need:
  - Controller class: actual APi code
  - Data field: data model for object
  - DTO class: outlines what data fields get exposed to the user
  - Mapper class: data model to DTO
  - Repository class: inherits from "JpaRepository"
- By default,
