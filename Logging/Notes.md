### Wide Logging
- Should have:
  - Structured (json) logging
  - High cardinality (unique fields): user_id, session_id, order_id, ect
  - High dimensionality and wide-event: one log event emitted per request per service with all relevant fields
- Use OpenTelemetry to aid in logging structure
- Can now run efficient queries on event data thanks to json structure
- Build wide-events during execution of program, adding context as request lifecycle continues
- Only save a sample of logs:
  - 100% of 500 errors, exceptions and failures
  - 100% of requests above p99 latency threshold
  - 100% of requests from specific users: VIPs, internal testing accounts, flagged sessions
  - 1-5% of all other successful requests
-  BigQuery data warehouses can be used to store large number of log events
