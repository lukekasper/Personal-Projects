Docker Containerization ToDo list:
- update requirements.txt to include all app dependencies
- update app to be compatible with MySQL database
- save the AppleScript code as an application:
  - Click on "File" in the menu bar, then select "Save..."
  - Choose a location to save the application.
  - Set "File Format" to "Application" (this is important).
  - Give the application a name (e.g., "Start My App").
  - Click "Save."
